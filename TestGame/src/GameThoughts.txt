Player Stats:
    Not Implemented - General Stats:
        The player doesn't have intrisic stats. All stats come from equipment and weapons.
        The equipped weapon will provide x flat base damage, and other equipment can provide % modifiers
    Not Implemented - Energy: 
        Players have access to multiple abilities from their weapon and armor each turn. Using abilities will cost a variable amount of energy.
        Energy regains per turn in battle and refills upon leaving battle.
        Going low on energy incurs a damage penalty.
        You can optionally "basic attack" for no energy, but this deals 50% base damage
    Not Implemented - Damage:
        


Equipment:
    Not Implemented - Spells:
        Inspired by Albion, each piece of equipment will have at least 1 spell (possibly multiple, maybe influenced by item rank).
        Spells can be offensive, defensive, buff oriented, or other.


Monsters:
    Not Implemented - Tiers:
        Monsters have intrinsic tiers related to the zone you are currently in. The vast majority of monsters should be of the same tier of the zone.
        Monsters stats are directly influenced by tier (possibly linear scaling? or exponential?).
    Not Implemented - Stats:
        Monsters, unlike players, have intrinsic stats and abilities.
        Abilities are chosen from a pool for a given monster. Higher tier monsters will have more variety in their abilities.
